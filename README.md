Student Club Application

This project is Student Club Application which is for student clubs and their members. With this application, while board
members can see their events in the event calendar and who will join the event, members can see events'
details and join the event which they want. The aim of this application is to make it easier to publish their events to members for
student clubs, and see and follow events for club members.
